Develop an algorithm (Java or C++) that can find the ratio of the sum of the largest two numbers divided by the sum of the smallest two numbers in an array. The solution should be linear or better.  

For example:
If the input is 
int[] a={3,5,12,450,1,1,5,6,23,6,8,9,321,2,3};

The ratio is (450+321) / (1+1) = 385.5.
